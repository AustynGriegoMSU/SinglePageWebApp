## Overview:
This is a simple one page web application that generates a tip calculation for a user inputed check amount. For example enter a $20.00 Bill the page will return tip calculation with the totals for 22%, 20%, and 18% tip amounts. 

## Functionality: Features and functionality description
The prgram uses an html file format, to get user to input a specific bill amount for a restaurant/service. From there a Javascript section in the html handles the calculations that are returned to user on the app (all in one page). The features of the app could be enhanced, however for this project we were looking for a more basic webapp. Styling was covered under the style section in the html, using CSS.

## Choices and Challenges: Development process choices and challenges
For development, i started with a picture/outline of what I was to accomplish in this project. From there I had the template and began changing the html file to get a basic render of my web app. After that I worked the styling, and calculation, for me this took the longest. I was trying to create a seperate file for both my JS and CSS segments. After a couple hours of work/research on why it would not return the calculations or style my page, I was able to find how to internally implement these segments in my html file. From that point on, I was just modifying my page using CSS and got it to a working and more visually enhanced version.
