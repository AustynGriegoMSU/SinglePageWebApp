## COPY TO TEXT IN CANVAS SUBMISSION
From this experience I have gained insight to how a page is styled and coded to a web application page. I learned how to internally implement JS and CSS scripting and styling straight into my index.html file. Lastly, as I have used AI to help me program before this project, doing this with no generative AI shows the importance of the basics and knowing what the code does (including code outside this project that is AI written/modified).

The main challenge I faced is that I have never worked with javascript or CSS so to create a page from minimal knowledge required some research online (mostly W3Schools).

I am much more confident in the html formatting processes as im code structure, brackets, etc. I definitely need to continue learning/growing skills in implementing javascript and CSS to style a page.

For this mini project I used W3Schools to learn to use css and js in my html file, this site is super helpful and I plan on using it for future projects, so glad you introduced it to us! I also used Github for the project template, source control and coding aspects.
